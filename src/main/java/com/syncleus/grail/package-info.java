/**
 * GRAIL is an Algorithm Implementation layer that allows arbitrary algorithms to be backed, and executed from, a graph
 * database. The backing graph database can be either an on-disk server instance or a purely local in-memory instance.
 * This allows generic tools to be interfaced to accomplish an assortment of extensions such as: distributed processing,
 * visualizations, indexing, graph traversal, SPARQL queries and much more.
